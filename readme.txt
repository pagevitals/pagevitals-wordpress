Integrates PageVitals Field Testing (RUM) into your WordPress site.

== Description ==

**PageVitals** is a RUM plugin that integrates the power of PageVitals into your WordPress site. PageVitals is a web performance tool that helps you measure and improve the speed, reliability, and overall experience of your website. With a focus on Core Web Vitals, PageVitals allows you to monitor key performance metrics, including Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), Time to First Byte (TTFB), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

The PageVitals plugin enhances your website's performance by collecting real-time data from actual visitors, giving you invaluable insights into how your site performs under real-world conditions. This information allows you to understand how users experience your website, where performance bottlenecks occur, and how to prioritize improvements to ensure a fast and engaging user experience.

3. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Monitor slow-loading assets, heavy scripts, and third-party services that may be holding back your site’s performance.
4. **Boost Engagement and SEO**: Sites that load faster keep visitors engaged longer and improve your rankings on search engines, giving your site an edge over competitors.
5. **Make Informed Decisions**: Use real user data to decide what areas of your site need optimization and measure the results of your changes.
